Today in class, I spent some time on Adobe Photoshop© trying to make an interesting infographic for this website. I think that the importance of trying to make your website look good is often underestimated. As is true with most things, first impressions matter. Whenever anybody comes to look at our site, we want them to like what they see so that they want to to come again. It’s simple. 
<br>
Photoshop© is a great place to make anything from logos to infographics. I was doing the latter.  Infographics are a good way to draw people’s attention through colorful creativity while also giving them important information. People tend to spend more time looking at interesting pictures than dull ones. The organization matters as well including the color pallet which can decide the tone of the message.
<br>

How to make an Infographic:
<br>
Open up Adobe Photoshop in your browser.  I use the CS3 version.
<br>
Go to file and open up a new project. 
<br>
You will be started with a plain white background. By going to the sidebar on the left of the screen and pressing the fill icon, you can change this to any color you want. After this, press Ctrl + Shift + N to create a new layer. The layer will show up near the bottom right corner of your screen.
<br>
Go to the left sidebar again and press the text icon (the T). Make sure that you are on your new layer, and then drag out the tool, effectively creating a text box.
<br>
Write whatever you want!
<br>
Make another layer. This time, explore some of the tools on the sidebar. Use the airbrush, shapes, or some other tool to customize your infographic!
<br>
When you’re done, press Ctrl + S and save the infographic to your computer!

                    Wednesday  August 3 
    Today we met a Starbucks from 9-3. We worked on the business plan and finished about 10 pages. We also fixed the website. It was very challenging changing the color but eventually we did. How you have colored letters is you use style = "color: the color of your choice" On the contact page we worked so when you pressed the email it would take you to a link so you could send us stuff. It took a long time to finish but we worked hard and succeeded.

How to make a logo:
<br>
So, one of the most important things in starting a business is creating a logo. It represents your company when you market your business. So how do you make a good logo?
First, you need to have a color scheme or palette. A color scheme is a set of general colors that you use in your logo. A palette is the exact colors. Basically, no difference between them. A good website for finding color schemes is http://paletton.com/. 
Next you need to plan out your logo. What do you want your logo to represent? If it’s a drawing company (if that’s a thing), you don’t want a logger eating a Snickers for your logo. You want it to relate to your company. 
Don’t make it messy, that’ll reflect on what type of business you are. It’ll show you have a sloppy business that you don’t care about. 
And be sure to have different ideas of what your logo’s going to be, so if for some reason you can’t use one logo, there’s always other logos you can choose from. Plus, you might find one better than the one you were planning.
When you think you found  a good design, open up any drawing program and start outlining your design. Then use the fill bucket and fill it in with the colors you’ve chosen. If you have text, make sure it stands out from the colors so it’s easier to read. Finally, make the background transparent. It should have a checkered pattern of white and light gray in the background if it’s transparent. And you’re done!  </p>
