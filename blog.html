Today in class, I spent some time on Adobe Photoshop© trying to make an interesting infographic for this website. I think that the importance of trying to make your website look good is often underestimated. As is true with most things, first impressions matter. Whenever anybody comes to look at our site, we want them to like what they see so that they want to to come again. It’s simple. 
<br>
Photoshop© is a great place to make anything from logos to infographics. I was doing the latter.  Infographics are a good way to draw people’s attention through colorful creativity while also giving them important information. People tend to spend more time looking at interesting pictures than dull ones. The organization matters as well including the color pallet which can decide the tone of the message.
<br>

How to make an Infographic:
<br>
Open up Adobe Photoshop in your browser.  I use the CS3 version.
<br>
Go to file and open up a new project. 
<br>
You will be started with a plain white background. By going to the sidebar on the left of the screen and pressing the fill icon, you can change this to any color you want. After this, press Ctrl + Shift + N to create a new layer. The layer will show up near the bottom right corner of your screen.
<br>
Go to the left sidebar again and press the text icon (the T). Make sure that you are on your new layer, and then drag out the tool, effectively creating a text box.
<br>
Write whatever you want!
<br>
Make another layer. This time, explore some of the tools on the sidebar. Use the airbrush, shapes, or some other tool to customize your infographic!
<br>
When you’re done, press Ctrl + S and save the infographic to your computer!

                    Wednesday  August 3 
    Today we met a Starbucks from 9-3. We worked on the business plan and finished about 10 pages. We also fixed the website. It was very challenging changing the color but eventually we did. How you have colored letters is you use style = "color: the color of your choice" On the contact page we worked so when you pressed the email it would take you to a link so you could send us stuff. It took a long time to finish but we worked hard and succeeded.

How to make a logo:
<br>
So, one of the most important things in starting a business is creating a logo. It represents your company when you market your business. So how do you make a good logo?
First, you need to have a color scheme or palette. A color scheme is a set of general colors that you use in your logo. A palette is the exact colors. Basically, no difference between them. A good website for finding color schemes is http://paletton.com/. 
Next you need to plan out your logo. What do you want your logo to represent? If it’s a drawing company (if that’s a thing), you don’t want a logger eating a Snickers for your logo. You want it to relate to your company. 
Don’t make it messy, that’ll reflect on what type of business you are. It’ll show you have a sloppy business that you don’t care about. 
And be sure to have different ideas of what your logo’s going to be, so if for some reason you can’t use one logo, there’s always other logos you can choose from. Plus, you might find one better than the one you were planning.
When you think you found  a good design, open up any drawing program and start outlining your design. Then use the fill bucket and fill it in with the colors you’ve chosen. If you have text, make sure it stands out from the colors so it’s easier to read. Finally, make the background transparent. It should have a checkered pattern of white and light gray in the background if it’s transparent. And you’re done!  </p>

How to Make a Google Slides Presentation

Although PowerPoint Presentations are still widely used, Google has come up with an alternative. Google Slides is now popular among kids, and is commonly used for school and other projects as an easy alternative to the sometimes difficult to reach PowerPoint.  As PowerPoint by Microsoft requires Microsoft Office it can not be accessible to schools. Where as Google Slides is the free online alternative. We are using Google Slides for our presentation to judges.
Let’s assume you want multiple slides in your presentation. First thing’s first, you need to press the plus sign to make more slides when needed. Don’t overdo it. 
Type in whatever information you need to say. Typically, the first slide is called title slide, where you show your title and a small one-sentence descriptive. A picture is recommended. The last slide is usually something along the lines of, “Thanks for listening!” or something that closes off your presentation. The rest is information that you need to present. 
Make sure you have pictures!

Today I worked on photoshop. I learned about quite a few things today. But what really stood out was composition, colors, and typography. These may seem like normal factors of any picture. Composition is the placement of the objects which are being displayed. What I learned about colors is that there are many different kinds, which include, primary colors, secondary colors, tertiary colors, analogous colors, and contrasting colors. Those are only a few of all the kinds/categories of colors. Primary colors are colors which cannot be made by other colors. The primary colors are: red, yellow, and blue. Secondary colors are colors that are made up of the primary colors. The secondary colors are: orange, green, and purple. Of course there are many different shades of these colors. Tertiary colors are colors that are made up of two secondary colors or colors that are made up of 3 colors. Tertiary colors can be made of three colors because they may be made if the same amount of primary color is mixed in with the same amount of a secondary color. Analogous colors are colors which are next to each other on the color wheel. An example would be red and orange. These colors go well together. An example of a pair of analogous colors  Contrasting colors are colors that are opposite of one another. This is what makes them go well together: each one of them reflects off of the other one. What I mean to say is that since, they are opposite, they make the other color look more vibrant. Blue and orange are contrasting colors. Typography is like font families. There are four font families: Serif, Sans Serif, Decorative, and Script. Serif is the font family that has tick marks on all of the letters. An example of a Serif font is Playfair Display. Sans Serif is the font family that doesn’t have the tick marks on the letters like Serif. This is because “Sans” means “without” An example of a Sans Serif font is Roboto Mono. Decorative is the font family that is mainly for show. Some of these fonts are hard to read, but they always catch the reader’s’ attention. An example of a Decorative font is Permanent marker. Script is the font family that is like cursive. An example of a Script font is Pinyon Script. What I found difficult was knowing when the proportions of the dullness and lightness of the background were proportionate to that of the text. (We did an activity that was creating a wanted poster.) I liked what we learned in Graphics Design and the possibilities of what can be creating using Photoshop.
